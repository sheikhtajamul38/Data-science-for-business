## Introduction

Data Science for Business course was offered in HSE University ans it serves an interdisciplinary field that applies scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. This repository serves as a collection of Jupyter Notebook files showcasing the implementation of machine learning algorithms for classification and regression problems.

## Code Implemented

The following machine learning algorithms and techniques have been implemented using Python:

1. Random Forests: Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a robust model. It is widely used for classification and regression tasks due to its ability to handle complex datasets and mitigate overfitting.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while preserving most of the original data's variance. It is often used for feature extraction and visualization.

3. t-SNE: t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction technique primarily used for visualization purposes. It is effective at capturing complex structures in high-dimensional data and mapping them to a lower-dimensional space.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sheikhtajamul38/Data-Science-for-Business.git
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in the repository's root directory:

   ```shell
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. You can now open the Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb) and execute the code cells.
